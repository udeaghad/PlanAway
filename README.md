## PlanAway üè©
PlanAway is an application that helps travelers plan their itinerary in the most optimal route saving time and money. It relies on Google Map API to get map details of the originating location of a user, the stopovers, and the routes. Travel Advisor from Rapid API was used to fetch restaurants and attractive places of visit surrounding the users' originating location. We created an algorithm to split these activities or selected places into the number of days for their visits based on distances.
